# Blocklists
This is a repository that combines multiple Adguard Home blocklists into a single file by deduplicating and compressing it using [HostlistCompiler](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistCompiler).

This list will be updated automatically with Github Actions at 10:30 PM and 10:30 AM UTC, or whenever a new list is added.
